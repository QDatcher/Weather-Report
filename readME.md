# Weather Report

## Description
 
    - This is meant to help the user keep track of the weather in different cities around the   world.
    - Using this the user can find the current temp, windspeed, humidity and a picture describing the weather status
    - The user also can see the weather for the next 5 days as well
    - By using this I have been increasing my knowledge of how to fetch api's and manipulating the DOM

## Usage



![Front page of the website ](assets/imgs/front-page.png)

- To begin the user must type a city name into the input on the left

- Once the user clicks the search button the cities weather info will be updated to the DOM
